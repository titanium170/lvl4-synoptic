# SynopticMediaPlayer

## Overview
This project represents the culmination of my level 4 apprenticeship, and was built in the course of a single week (5 days).

The spec was to create a simple audio media player.

I went beyond this and allowed the user to manage playlists, handle queues of media as well as save and load from files.

## Technologies used

Angular v11 is used for the majority of the codebase, as it is primarily a frontend-focused project.

Electron (+ NodeJS) was used to give a native app feel and allow access to the local filesystem.

The design is simple but modern and relies primarily on Angular Material.

RxJS has been used to manage state using observables.
